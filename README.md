# README for Atlas T2 Docker project #3001

## Introduction
This repository contains Docker-related projects to practice and learn about containerization, Docker basics, and microservices architecture. Docker is a powerful tool that allows developers to package applications into containersâ€”standalone executable packages that include everything needed to run the application, including the code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings.

In this project, I will explore Docker by setting up a simple yet comprehensive infrastructure for an application. This includes understanding and implementing a reverse proxy, load balancing, and managing multiple services within Docker containers.

## High-Level Design
The project involves designing and deploying a multi-service application architecture using Docker. The setup includes:
- A reverse proxy/load balancer server acting as the entry point.
- Two API servers for handling backend logic.
- One front-end server for serving static content.

Traffic routing and load balancing are managed through a round-robin algorithm, ensuring even distribution of requests among the API servers.

## Prerequisites
- Install Docker Desktop on your local computer. Instructions can be found at [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/).
- Familiarize yourself with Docker concepts and basics.

## Tasks

### Task 0: Create Your First Docker Image
Create a Docker image based on the latest Ubuntu, update APT, and upgrade all installed software. The Docker image should, upon execution, echo "Hello, World!" in the terminal.

### Task 1: Back-end
Develop a backend service using Python3, Flask, and Docker. Ensure your Dockerfile is set up to handle Python dependencies via pip.

### Task 2: Front-end
Set up a front-end service that serves static content. Use Nginx as the web server and configure it to serve your static files. Also, set up a port for listening to incoming requests.

### Task 3: Connecting the Front-end and Back-end
Implement communication between the front-end and back-end services. Ensure that the front-end can dynamically display data fetched from the back-end service.

### Task 4: Making it Simpler with Docker Compose
Use Docker Compose to simplify the management of your multi-container application. Define your services, build contexts, Dockerfiles, images, and ports in a `docker-compose.yml` file.

### Task 5: Proxy Server
Implement a proxy server using JavaScript in your HTML file. This server will route requests to the appropriate service based on the request URL.

### Task 6: Scale Horizontally
Scale your application horizontally by adding multiple instances of your API server. Use Docker Compose to manage these instances.
